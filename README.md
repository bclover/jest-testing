## Jest Testing

A simple project to code along to Stephen Grider's 'Advanced React & Redux Course' from Udemy.com. This particular lesson and project revolves around unit testing a simple app with Jest. As I have much more experience with Mocha, Jasmine, and Enzyme I wanted to go thru this and learn Jest and compare it's features and syntax to those other unit testing frameworks. Cheers!
